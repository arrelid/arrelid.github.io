title: Improving the download pane in Google Chrome
---

Google Chrome uses a tiny pane at the bottom of its windows to collect and visualize your most recent downloads. If you want to open a downloaded file, just click its representation in the download pane. This even works for files that are not completely downloaded just yet; click on such a file, and it will be queued for opening when the download is complete.

So, how to make the download pane even better? Why not allow the user to âŒ˜-click a downloaded file to have Chrome open its parent folder in Finder, with the clicked-on item selected? That sure would make my day.
