title: Apple App Store's approval moment 22
---

This is almost too good to be true: submit an application to the App Store, get it approved by Apple and enjoy the fact that you yourself can no longer reject the app.

Yes, it's true. You have to release the (by Apple) approved binary before you can upload a new version to the App Store. I guess those apples can decide whether the approved (but not released) version contains serious bugs better than you can.

For your Radar loving people: I have emitted some bug reporting love in the shape of [rdar://8712273](rdar://8712273). For you, mr. Average Joe, there's always [the dupe](http://openradar.appspot.com/8712273) in Open Radar.
