title: Google Chrome - Evolution at its best
---

I've been using [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) for quite some time now, and I would go as far as saying that it's one of very few applications I couldn't live without.

So how come I'm so found of it? Because it's constantly evolving into an even easier to use application - for all kind of users (the newbie, the average Joe and the poweruser). I can't even recall _one_ other application that evolves as quickly as Chrome (you have to remember that the [first release](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome#History) of Chrome was made public in September 2008).

On the other hand... I might be a bit biased; a couple of weeks back I made a suggestion about how [the downloads pane could be improved](http://log.arrelid.com/post/2163909334/improving-the-download-pane-in-google-chrome), and today I noticed that my suggestion had turned into reality. That's a pretty quick turnaround.

You go ahead and call me fanboy, but Chrome definitely has my heart.
