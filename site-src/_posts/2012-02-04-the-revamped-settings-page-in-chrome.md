title: The revamped settings page in Chome
---

There's so much to like about Google Chrome, and the revamped settings layout makes it even more lovely. Google might be less _don't be evil_ nowadays, but they should still get credit for their never ending quest to produce a kick-ass browser.

[Download the developer build of Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/eula_dev.html?dl=mac) and give it a spin yourself!

(To be totally honest, I would probably put even more focus on the search feature in the settings view - the first time on this page I might know _what_ I'm looking for, but not _where_ it can be found.)
