title: Good bye search field, hello omnibox
---

For those of you who haven't tried out Google Chrome's [omnibox](http://chrome.blogspot.com/2009/06/get-to-know-omnibox.html) just yet, please do so now.

Done? Good. Now please enjoy the fact that Google has opened up the API powering it so that you can do stuff like [this](http://blog.chromium.org/2011/02/extending-omnibox.html). Gotta ‚ù§ Google sometimes.
