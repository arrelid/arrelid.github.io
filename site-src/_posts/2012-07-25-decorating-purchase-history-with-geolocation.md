title: Decorating purchase history with (geo)location
---

Coming back from the summer vacation, you suddenly wish that you could see the (geo)location of that suspicious looking entry in your latest bank statement. iZettle to the rescue; “The new app also comes with an improved payments history tab that displays every purchase location on a map”.

The "new" app means [the one released in February this year](https://www.izettle.com/2012/02/15/fresh-on-the-shelves-izettle-1-7/).
