title: Can haz focus?
---

Dear operating system,

* I'm sitting here typing away like there was no tomorrow. Programming and shit you know. I'm down with this stuff! (nah, I'm not, but I can still pretend, right?)
* You decide that it's about time to present some modal sheet/window. I have no clue why, but you know better (I mean, you've got like cycles and shit man!). And of course - why let me keep the input focus? Nah, just give it to that cute little fluffy sheet instead. I definitely approve, no, encourage, you to do so!
* Since I'm not really into those megabits and HTTPs (interwebs?), I'm still typing. You know that space key? I actually try to hit that little piece of plastic sometimes (hard to hit, I know!). Like even though I've obviously lost focus already.

WHAT. THE. FUCK. JUST. HAPPENED?!! What did I just accept?

Solution: if you're about to throw a modal sheets in my face, please disable keyboard input until I press some really hard to produce keyboard shortcut or until a timer runs out. It can't be that hard right?
