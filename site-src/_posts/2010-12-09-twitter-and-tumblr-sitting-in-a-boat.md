title: Twitter and Tumblr, sitting in a boat
---

Regarding the recent downtime on Tumblr - why haven't anyone made fun of the two services reliance on each other? Twitter uses a Tumblr blog as its [status page](http://status.twitter.com/), while as Tumblr uses a Twitter account to [communicate with the world when shit goes down](http://twitter.com/tumblr).

I'm eagerly awaiting the day when both services goes down _simultaneously_.
