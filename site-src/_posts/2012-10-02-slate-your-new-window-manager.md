title: Slate - Your new window manager
---

_Update May 21, 2016: I've since replaced Slate with [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/)._

If you're attached to your keyboard (who isn't?), you might just enjoy [Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) - a window manager for Mac OS X that doesn't suck balls. While it might not come with shiny tutorials (like [Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/) and [SizeUp](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/)), it truly shines when it comes to customization - and that's what you really care about anyway, right?

Give it a try. You won't regret it.
