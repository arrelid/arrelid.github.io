title: The 'Browse in Spotify' service revisited
---

[Since I wrote](http://log.arrelid.com/post/2510765809/a-search-in-spotify-service-for-mac-os-x) about how to invoke a system service to browse for the selected text snippet in Spotify, I've managed to sneak some code into the Spotify desktop application that does just this.

So, just [download the latest version of Spotify](http://spotify.com/download) and make sure to set some appropriate keyboard shortcut to the service (using the _Keyboard_ pane in _System Preferences_).

Then select some text (or a Spotify link) in Chrome/Firefox (or any other Mac application) and invoke the service shortcut to have Spotify browse the selection.

Happy Spotify browsing!
