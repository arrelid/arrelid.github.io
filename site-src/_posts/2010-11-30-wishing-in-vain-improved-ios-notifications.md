title: Wishing in vain - improved iOS notifications
---

This is old news for all of you iOS device owners out there, but I'm now officially tired of Apple's design of notifications. This goes without saying, but I despise the behavior of both local and push notifications (since they don't really differ in anything but origin).

The basic problem with Apple's implementation is that a notification on an iOS device _either_ takes over the session (modal message boxes anyone?), _or_ is discarded (this happens all the time if you get notifications while the screen is locked). My idea of a notification is that you get _notified_ of that something has happened, and then the OS lets _you_ choose whether you want to act on it or not.

This can't be too hard to fix, so please learn from the [pros](http://www.palm.com/) and make use of that [Dellinger you hired this summer](http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/09/palm-loses-webos-notifications-architect-to-apple/) to get your shit together prior to releasing the next major iOS version. I know you can do better, hence I expect to be surprised and delighted. Just over-deliver, like you usually do, and everyone will be happy.
