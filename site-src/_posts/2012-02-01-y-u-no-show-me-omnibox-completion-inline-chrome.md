title: Y U NO SHOW ME OMNIBOX COMPLETION INLINE CHROME?
---

Got too much time on your hands? Then why don't you take the latest dev version of Chrome (I'm running 18.0.1017.2) for a spin and have a peek at the [autocomplete behavior in the omnibox](http://d.pr/M9IU). Tried it (or watched the video)? Can you spot the difference between Safari and Chrome?

Hint: Chrome no longer adds the missing characters from the URL representing its top hit to the characters you just typed.

This is somewhat strange - if I press enter, Chrome sure does load the top hit from the omnibox dropdown menu. Regression or feature, or something not ready for prime time just yet? I'd say the current implementation is broken - you shouldn't have to move your eyes to the first hit in the omnibox to see what will get invoked when you hit enter...
