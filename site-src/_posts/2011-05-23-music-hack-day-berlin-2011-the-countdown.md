title: Music Hack Day Berlin 2011 - The countdown
---

I'm going to [Music Hack Day Berlin](http://berlin.musichackday.org/2011/) this weekend. Can't really say how psyched I am - the combination of a wonderful venue, [Roel](https://twitter.com/roelven) and [Johan](https://twitter.com/freenerd) organizing the event and the general awesomeness of Berlin will surely make this weekend one to remember.

If you're heading there yourself, please grab me and say 'hi'. I'll most probably be able to answer most of your [Spotify](http://spotify.com/) related questions, and if not... I'll owe you a d√∂ner or two.
