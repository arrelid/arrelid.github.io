Ah... the holidays! Time for some relaxing [void](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1191111/), or just an hour or two with your favorite video game? In fact, let's skip the void and just do video games, right?

For those of you who still have some time to spare, I cannot recommend [Limbo](http://limbogame.org/) enough - it's hands down the most beautiful and exciting game I've played in many years. The mood, the shaky camera with its noisy film... it's not just _noir_, it's the definition of what it should feel like playing a video game.
