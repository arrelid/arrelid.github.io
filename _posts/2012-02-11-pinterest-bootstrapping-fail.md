title: Pinterest bootstrapping fail
---

[Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/) sure has one of the slickest registration flows out there, but for some reason they aren't bootstrapping (or even suggesting) pins for your default boards. This means that my first time experience visiting my (auto-added) friends profiles looks like this 9 out of 10 times.

This doesn't make sense. Even auto-adding some _random_ pins (think in terms like how they do this with your Facebook friends) would make newly created profile pages immensely more interesting.
