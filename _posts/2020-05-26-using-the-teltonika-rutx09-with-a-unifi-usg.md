title: Using the Teltonika RUTX09 with a UniFi USG
---

Like many others, I‚Äôve been working from home ever since COVID-19 took a solid grip of the world. While I‚Äôm fairly used to remote work, I‚Äôve never done it for longer stretches. Days? Sure. Weeks? Stretching it. Months? Not so much.

Aside from missing the coffee machine and my coworkers, the home office setup has turned out to be pretty manageable. There‚Äôs just one thing that‚Äôs been nagging me - the video conference calls I‚Äôve been on have all been quite choppy, and while this is fine for the occasional call, it isn‚Äôt as fun when you‚Äôre in multiple calls every day.

The culprit seems to be our apartment‚Äôs internet connection. 100/10 Mbps handles movie streaming and the occasional gaming session just fine, but when you throw some video conferencing into the mix it simply can‚Äôt keep up.

So... we need faster upload speeds, right? Problem? The ISP serving our apartment doesn‚Äôt have any reasonable upgrade paths :/

With this in mind, I started to look into mobile broadband options. Sweden has some pretty solid 4G infrastructure in place, and it‚Äôs not unusual to get download speeds around 250-280 Mbps combined with upload speeds hovering around 40-50 Mbps - at least if you‚Äôre on 4G LTE. Promising, right?

Since our cable modem is hooked up to a Ubiquiti UniFi system (router, switch and two APs serves the vast majority of our apartment with blazingly fast _internal_ connection speeds), we should - in theory - be able to replace its WAN (our crappy cable modem) with a 4G LTE router and viola - problem solved? Turns out that theory can be turned into practice without too much headache \o/ Here‚Äôs a rough step-by-step guide of what I did.

First, you‚Äôll need to get your hands on a mobile broadband plan and a corresponding SIM. Since I was already paying my cellular provider for an extra data SIM, I decided to use that one. With a data SIM in my hand, I wanted to understand if it had a class A private IP address or a public one - remember that we‚Äôre throwing a proper router into the mix later, and we don‚Äôt want to end up with a double NAT setup if we can avoid it. Turned out I had a private address, but my cellular provider allowed me to turn it into a public one - self-serve style using their online customer portal <3.

With a data SIM ready, you‚Äôll need a capable router. I opted for a [Teltonika RUTX09](https://teltonika-networks.com/product/rutx09/), which comes with three (3!) 1000MB/s ethernet ports and full support for 4G LTE Cat 6 speeds - 300/50 Mbps. Finally, it supports bridge mode which disables most of its internal routing services, instead allowing it to simply pass on its public WAN IP to a router downstream. Again - bye-bye double NAT.

Setting the RUTX09 to operate in bridge mode wasn‚Äôt too complicated - the only thing you might want to keep in mind is that you‚Äôll want to figure out what MTU/MSS settings your mobile ISP enforces before you set it to bridge mode - doing so will make it simple to set the same ones for the USG later.

So, what steps are we looking at?

1. Insert your SIM into the router
2. Hook up your computer‚Äôs ethernet port to LAN1 on the router. Make sure you‚Äôve got your adapter set to DHCP mode.
3. Turn on the router and login through its web interface - check the manual for details on its IP, or check your network adapter to understand what address the router can be reached at.
5. Bridging wasn‚Äôt present in some of the earlier firmware versions, so make sure you‚Äôve got a [recent version](https://wiki.teltonika-networks.com/view/RUTX09_Firmware_Downloads) installed or you might not have the option to turn on bridge mode.
6. Factory reset the router to make sure it wipes any existing user settings. Shouldn‚Äôt be needed, but hey...
6. Enable the advanced (UI) mode by clicking on the ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù label at the top of the status overview.
7. Now first you want to make sure that WAN failover isn‚Äôt enabled. You do so in `Network ‚Üí Failover`. This should not be the case for a newly reset router, but hey...
8. Optional: if you _do_ have a WAN hooked up to the WAN port of the RUTX09, you‚Äôll need to make sure that the interface that corresponds to your mobile SIM is configured to be the primary network interface. Do so in  `Network ‚Äî> Interfaces`. On the version of RutOS I‚Äôm on, you can simply drag and drop the interfaces to re-order their priority. Don‚Äôt forget to save/apply your changes!
9. Reminder: Now before you enable bridge mode, try to figure out which [MTU/MSS settings](http://speedguide.net/analyzer.php) your mobile ISP enforces. Save these for later (most notably, the MSS value).
10. In `Network ‚Üí Interfaces`, press the configuration button for your mobile interface and select `Mode: Bridge` in the general tab section.
11. Optional: If you‚Äôve got more than one device hooked up to the RUTX09, you‚Äôll need to specify the MAC address of the device that the RUTX09 should pass on its public WAN to. Save/apply, and wait for the router apply the new configuration.
11. Disconnect your computer from the router, and connect LAN1 on the RUTX09 to the WAN port on the USG.

In a perfect world, you‚Äôre done now.

On the other hand... if you‚Äôre having problems accessing resources with your new and shiny setup - like TLS handshakes failing - you might need to adjust the USG‚Äôs MSS settings.

The MSS value can be setup by [in `config.gateway.json` on the UniFi controller](https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/215458888-UniFi-USG-Advanced-Configuration-Using-config-gateway-json). How?

To figure out what the relevant JSON blob should look like, SSH to the USG and configure its MSS value manually. There‚Äôs actually a mss-clamp value applied to a few selected interfaces already (like PPPoE), but we need to be applied for any outgoing connection, regardless of protocol.

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs an easier way to achieve this, but setting the same MSS value for all interfaces is simple and does the trick.

```
configure
set firewall options mss-clamp interface-type all
set firewall options mss-clamp mss 1400
commit
save
exit
```

Obviously, you‚Äôll need to replace the MSS value with whatever value your ISP enforces.

Then invoke...

```
mca-ctrl -t dump-cfg
```

Check the output to figure out what the relevant JSON blob that the controller needs look like. Here‚Äôs my version.

```
{
	"firewall": {
		"options": {
			"mss-clamp": {
				"interface-type": [
					"all"
				],
				"mss": "1400"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Copy this section to your `config.gateway.json` (i.e. deploy it to your controller), and force a provision of the USG. Once it‚Äôs up and running again, SSH to it and check that the new configuration has been applied.

```
mca-ctrl -t dump-cfg
```


Look out for the mss-clamp section in the JSON output - if it‚Äôs present, you‚Äôre good.

And that‚Äôs all folk. You‚Äôre now enjoying blazingly fast internet  over the air. Enjoy üëç!
