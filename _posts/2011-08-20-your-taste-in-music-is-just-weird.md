title: Your taste in music is just... weird
---

It struck me (again) the other day - I listen to music that most people find weird; lots of synthesized sounds, instrumentals, almost no lyrics, computers emitting strange noises etc. How could anyone fancy such things? On top of that, add a healthy piece of repetition.
