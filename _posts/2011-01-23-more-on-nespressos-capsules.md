title: More on Nespresso's capsules

![Capsules baby](/assets/posts-resources/nespresso-capsules.jpg)

This photo of the Nespresso capsule container depicts what I'd like the capsule itself to tell me; the intensity of the coffee within the capsule, and the amount of water I need when preparing it (is it a lungo? an espresso?). Can't get my head around why Nespresso haven't added this information to the capsule itself...
