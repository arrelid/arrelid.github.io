title: Why keeping count of unread objects counts
---

In the never ending _I'm bashing you because I'm not the one who is supposed to solve the problem_ series, we've now reached the point were I'm publicly going to whine about why keeping count of unread items is important.

Let's initiate the moaning process by touching on [my previous post on iOS notifications](http://log.arrelid.com/post/1984684928/wishing-in-vain-improved-ios-notifications): assume that my shiny new iPhone tells me I've got a new DM from someone I care about (that actually happens, from time to time!), but it just happens to be that I can't be bothered to take the time to check it our right now.

A few hours passes, and I have now forgotten about the notification I got on the phone. I fire up Chrome, say a little prayer, and navigate to Twitter and notice that I've got a DM waiting for me. That's kind of hot, because how would I otherwise get to know about [this awesome stuff](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UQ2vqFJvpA)?

Another hour passes, and I'm now on the tube. Looking at my phone, I realize that it is still shiny. Phew.

But wait, it's not only shiny - it also tells me, through a badge on Twitter.app, that I've got one new item that I need to take action on. Did I just get a new DM? Or a mention? Opening the app, I'm gently reminded of that "new" DM I read over an hour ago. Excuse me dear Twitter, but I wouldn't say that this is news to me.

This is why it's important to keep unread count state in the cloud; unread counts are basically worthless if they're not kept in sync. Some players do get it right though - Facebook seems to be using [Apple's push services](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/ApplePushService/ApplePushService.html) correctly and hence pushes a _new_ notification telling my phone to remove the badge if I've taken action on whatever new items I have on [facebook.com](http://facebook.com/) already.

But hey, I'll survive. Even though I would have preferred doing so without having Twitter telling me about yesterday's news.
