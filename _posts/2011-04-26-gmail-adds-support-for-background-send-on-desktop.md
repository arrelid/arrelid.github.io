title: Gmail adds support for "background send" on desktop
---

Fellow iOS Gmail users has already enjoyed the feature for some time, and apparently it works well enough for Google to [let you turn it on yourself](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2011/04/new-in-labs-background-send.html).

Still seems a bit shaky re. file uploads in the background - you need to have the e-mail (and any attachments) "finished" before pressing send for the backgrounding to work flawlessly. Still, it's a step in the right direction - asynchronous operations ftw.
