title: I'll just download this, OK?
---

Oh Chrome,

Whenever I kindly ask you to download something for me, you keep on insisting that you need to throw that “This type of file can harm your computer. Do you want to keep _random-file.dmg_ anyway?” dialog. Why, oh why? Obviously, you're one step ahead of me already - before I manage to react and reach out for my mouse, you've started pre-downloading the file. That's so nice of you - it's like you know that I never say never!?

But seriously, let me turn of that freaking warning. Ok? You know how I hate to use my mouse.

Love,
Mattias
