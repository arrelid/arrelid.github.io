title: Restoring from iCloud? Prepare for POPUP HELL!
---

I just restored my phone from an iCloud backup, and boy... this sure is a sweet feature!

What wasn't so sweet was the number of popups I had to click through once the phone had rebooted from the restore - I counted to _more than 20 popups_ asking me for passwords, lock codes, confirmations and general "you need to know this" information dialogues. That's not cool Apple, _not_ cool at all. Here's my suggestion of how to fix this:

1. Cache my freaking Apple ID credentials once I've entered them. Seriously, it's still me using the phone 5 seconds later.
2. NEVER EVER EVER EVER interrupt a two step lock code setup with another popup in between the first and second entry of the new lock code, ok?

Ok, I just had to get that out of my system. Back to real life.
