title: Mr App Store - I heard you like screenshots
---

My number one gripe with the concept of _app stores_; why don't they allow developers to upload videos showcasing their apps? A moving series of pictures tells the story _so_ much better than a few screenshots.

And for the record; most companies have [these](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVGIiQmChFg) [videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBieYjxUj5Q) [made](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV2__tmrEbM) _anyways_, but it would be nice to be able to watch them in the app store instead of having to visit a random company web page.
