title: The universal editor
---


While watching Bret Victor presenting [“Inventing on Principle”](http://vimeo.com/36579366), I learnt about [Larry Tesler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Tesler) and his strong preference for modeless software. Larry was one of the authors behind [Gypsy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gypsy_(software)), pioneering the maybe-not-so-sexy domain of text input. Instead of forcing users to switch between text insertion mode and command modes, Gypsy was _always_ in insertion mode, relying on _function keys_ to perform operations like searching for and replacing text.

While this indeed was a tremendous breakthrough, I'm not sure that it solves the generic problem of working with text insertion/editing on a computer - if you shuffle text all day long, you'll want most, if not all, of your applications to obey the same function keys. This problem has been solved for the casual user - the operating system has assigned global function keys (and corresponding keyboard shortcuts) for operations that are likely to be invoked by most users. This only scales for so long - remember that most applications provide special functionality that doesn't exist in other software. This has lead to a somewhat [awkward workflow for some people](http://brent.simmons.usesthis.com/), but what to do? Editing text in one application and then have another application pick up where the editor of choice doesn't take you seems like a common enough workflow nowadays.

What's the preferred solution at hand? Enter [QuickCursor](https://github.com/jessegrosjean/quickcursor), a nifty little app that “brings your favorite text editor to any app with a global keyboard shortcut”. While this might sound cheesy, you should definitely spend a minute or two watching [this simple video demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bHwcyHrRGs) that shows its ingenious simplicity.

Until a native OS level solution exists, I'll happily support [Jesse Grosjean](https://twitter.com/#!/jessegrosjean). If you can't get enough of [your editor of choice](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim), you might just want to do so too.
