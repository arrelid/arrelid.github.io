title: Using your Mac to prepare Garmin's Marine Device Software Updates
---

My dad recently purchased a Garmin echoMAP CHIRP 72sv. Checking its software version, I realized there was a newer version available over at Garmin's website. The problem? Garmin seems to think that everyone loves Windows (nor doesn't know how to copy a file to an SD card manually). There has to be a fix for that, right?

```bash
$ brew install p7zip
$ 7z e ~/Downloads/echoMAPwithSDCard_20160606.exe
```

TBC...
